Here is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about sedFoam:

\section CFL How to choose the CFL number?

sedFoam is based on the PISO algorithm which is an unsteady flow algorithm even when we are looking at steady-state solutions. Another point is the coupling between the two-phase which adds another constraint on the time step. The choice of the time step also depends on the ddt scheme that you are using, values of order unity is possible when using upwind schemes but lower values are required when using second order temporal schemes such as backward or Crank-Nicholson scheme. According to our experience, it is necessary to use a CFL number smaller than unity and sometimes smaller than 0.3 or even less (0.1). The stability of the model remains a difficult problem and more theoretical work is needed to improve this point.
