@brief How To use github to contribute to sedFoam development

\tableofcontents

Here is a How To about using and contributing to the development of sedFoam. This page is organised in two sections:

- \ref howtoclone 
- \ref improvingsedfoam

//****************************************
\section howtoclone Simple user level: How to download and update sedFoam sources 

Cloning SedFoam GitHub repository and creates a local copy on your
computer:

On https://github.com/SedFoam/sedfoam, there's a green button labeled Clone. Click the button 
to see the web address. This URL address must be copied to your clipboard. 
In the terminal, navigate to the location on your computer where you would like to locate the repository. 
Then, type the following git command to clone the repository:
\verbatim
git clone https://github.com/SedFoam/sedfoam.git
\endverbatim

The cloning process takes a few seconds. SedFoam directory is created which contains the same list
of files and folders as the GitHub page. 

SedFoam github repository is updated regularly and to stay up-to-date with the latest version it is not necessary
to download SedFoam again. Instead, we recommend to execute the following command:
\verbatim
git pull
\endverbatim

Previous command will incorporate the changes from a remote repository
into the your local directory. This command should only be invoked if you are a
SedFoam user. If you are making changes to the code or developing new features
for SedFoam, please take a look at the next section.

//****************************************
\section improvingsedfoam Advanced user level: How to contribute to sedFoam development

This part of the getting started guide provides an overview of the git actions
beyond the basic commands explained in previous section. This tutorial is
intended to be a guide for developers who want to contribute, collaborate and
work with SedFoam community. By the end of this tutorial you will learn how
to:
- \ref createfork 
- \ref createbranch 
- \ref commitchanges 
- \ref pullrequest 


//****************************************
\subsection createfork Creating your own fork

First of all, we need to know that in a collective project we are all in the same
page. Thus, there is a common repository everyone has access to. That's, once
again: https://github.com/SedFoam/sedfoam.

To avoid unwanted modifications, irreversible mistakes, or untested new fea-
tures, direct code changes in the common repository are not allowed. Instead,
a maintainer needs to review and accept the commits from any developer who
wants to contribute to the project.

If you want to collaborate and create new content for SedFoam you should develop your 
changes in a GitHub fork. A fork is a copy of a repository which links
the original repository (https://github.com/SedFoam/sedfoam) and your personal copy. 
Forks allow you to edit the contents of your forked repository without
impacting the original repository.

In order to create your SedFoam fork go to https://github.com/SedFoam/sedfoam 
and click the Fork button.
Currently, your fork only exists on GitHub. To be able to work on the
project, you need to clone it to your computer:
\verbatim
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/sedfoam.git
\endverbatim
Previous URL is found in your SedFoam fork. 

It is strongly recommended to keep your fork up to date by tracking the
original upstream repository that you forked. To do so, you need to add a
remote:
\verbatim
# Add 'upstream' repo to list of remotes
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SedFoam/sedfoam.git

# Verify the new remote named 'upstream'
git remote -v
\endverbatim


It is good practice to periodically update your fork with the latest version
of the original (usptream) repository. First, fetch the upstream repository's
branches and latest commits to bring them into your repository:
\verbatim
# Fetch from upstream remote
git fetch upstream

# View all branches, including those from upstream
git branch -va
\endverbatim

At this point you need to make sure your branch (we'll discuss them later)
is the master branch:
\verbatim
# Checkout the master branch
git checkout master
\endverbatim

Then you can merge the upstream repository's master branch:
\verbatim
# Merge upstream
git merge upstream/master
\endverbatim

Now, your local master branch is up-to-date!

//****************************************
\subsection createbranch Create branches

Branching is the way to work on several versions of a repository at the same
time. By default your repository has one branch named master. Whenever you
begin to develop a new feature, it's important to create a new branch (a copy of
the master branch). It is common to use a certain branch for each new feature.
Experimenting in new branches is not only a good practice, but it also helps you
keep the changes organized and separated from the master branch. To create a
new branch, first, you want to make sure you are in the master branch:
\verbatim
git checkout master
\endverbatim

Then, a new branch named Newfeature (you can give the name you want)
is created typing:
\verbatim
git branch Newfeature
\endverbatim

We have, so far, created a copy of the master branch called Newfeature. To
start working in the new branch you should execute the following command:
\verbatim
git checkout Newfeature
\endverbatim


//****************************************
\subsection commitchanges Make and commit changes

Every time you make important changes in your local repository, it's worth
uploading the modifications on your GitHub branch. Keeping your changes
remotely on GitHub will store your modifications in a safe place and it will be
accessible from anywhere, so you don't need to be in your computer to work
in your new feature. Additionally, commit messages will capture the history of
your changes, so other contributors can see and understand your work. First of
all, you can run:
\verbatim
git status
\endverbatim

to display the state of the repository and see the tracked and untracked files.
Changes not staged and untracked files can be easily included with:
\verbatim
git add <File Name>
\endverbatim

In order to add changes from all tracked and untracked file you can execute:
\verbatim
git add -A
\endverbatim

In case you want to delete some files:
\verbatim
git rm <File Name>
\endverbatim

Then, files staged in your local repository need to be committed:
\verbatim
git commit -m "Write a message describing the new feature you introduce"
\endverbatim

Finally, to upload your changes to your remote branch on GitHub, you should
use:
\verbatim
git push origin Newfeature
\endverbatim

After executing the last command, you pushed the changes in your local
repository to the remote repository, both named Newfeature.

//****************************************
\subsection pullrequest Open a Pull Request

Whenever you consider the new feature is ready, you can propose your changes
and request someone to review your work. The maintainer will carefully study
the new features and, eventually, if they are sound, he/she will pull in your
contribution and merge it into the master branch.

The easiest way to carry out a pull requests is to go to your GitHub fork
and click the pull request button on the main repository page. Then click on
the New pull request green button.

The maintainer will decide to merge/deny or comment your changes. If the
maintainer suggests some modifications before merging, you can simply push
these changes into your fork and the pull request will be updated automatically.
