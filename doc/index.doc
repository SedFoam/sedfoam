<!--SedFOAM Manual-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
A three-dimensional two-phase flow solver, SedFoam, is presented for sediment transport applications. The solver is based on twoPhaseEulerFoam available in the 2.1.0 release of the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM. In this approach the sediment phase is modeled as a continuum, and constitutive laws have to be prescribed for the sediment stresses. In the proposed solver, two different inter-granular stress models are implemented: the kinetic theory of granular flows and the dense granular flow rheology $\mu(I)$. For the fluid stress, laminar or turbulent flow regimes can be simulated and three different turbulence models are available for sediment transport: a simple mixing length model (one-dimensional configuration only), a $k-\epsilon$ and a $k-\omega$ model. The numerical implementation is first demonstrated by two validation test cases, sedimentation of suspension and laminar bed-load, and two applications are then shown to illustrate the capabilities of \sedFoam to deal with complex turbulent sediment transport problems. Different combinations of inter-granular stress and turbulence models are tested. The source code and tutorial cases are disseminated at the public website: https://bitbucket.org/sedfoam/sedfoam and detailed tutorial description and documentation can be found at http://servforge.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/pub/soft-sedfoam/.

This manual is written as the documentation of the open-source solver SedFOAM, it includes the installation procedure and a description of the model input/output files.  The details concerning the mathematical formulation and the numerical implementation can be found in Chauchat, Cheng, Bonamy, Nagel, Hsu (Geophysical Model Development, submitted).

The documentation is divided into two parts, the first one is the user manual:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref install explains how to download, compile and install SedFoam.
<li>Section \ref starting gives informations on how the case directory is organised. 
<li>Section \ref tutorials describes the tutorials provided with SedFoam sources including postprocessing using a python toolbox also provided with the source and the expected results. 
<li>Section \ref faq gives answers to frequently asked questions. 
<li>Section \ref trouble gives some basic answers about what to do in case of problems.
</ul>


The second part provides informations for developers.
