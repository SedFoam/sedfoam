<h2>Introduction</h2>
This documentation describes the three-dimensional two-phase flow solver for sediment transport applications:  SedFoam. The solver is based on twoPhaseEulerFoam available in the official release of the open-source CFD software OpenFOAM (based on OF2.4). In this approach the sediment phase is modeled as a continuum, and constitutive laws have to be prescribed for the sediment stresses. In the proposed solver, two different inter-granular stress models are implemented: the kinetic theory of granular flows and the dense granular flow rheology &mu(I). For the fluid stress, laminar or turbulent flow regimes can be simulated and three different turbulence models are available for sediment transport: a simple mixing length model (one-dimensional configuration only), a &k-&epsilon and a &k-&omega model. 

Different easy benchmarks/tutorials_1d are provided to illustrate the model capabilities: a sedimentation of spherical partiles at low Reynolds number, the laminar bed-load problem, the turbulent sheet-flow regime. Moreover some advanced multi-dimensional cases/tutorials_2d3d are proposed. The source code and tutorial cases are disseminated at the public website: https://github.com/sedfoam/sedfoam and detailed tutorial description.

This manual is written as the documentation of the open-source solver sedFoam, it includes the installation procedure and a description of the model input/output files. 

The sedfoam solver should be referenced using the GMD paper :

Chauchat, J., Cheng, Z., Nagel, T., Bonamy, C., and Hsu, T.-J. (2017) SedFoam-2.0: a 3-D two-phase flow numerical model for sediment transport, Geosci. Model Dev., 10, 4367-4392, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4367-2017.

and the reference in which a specific configuration and/or feature has been first presented (please see list of references in the documentation).
If you are using a sedFoam version without modification, you should also refer to the Zenodo DOI of the version, current version is https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.836642



The documentation is divided into two parts, the first one is the user manual:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref install explains how to download, compile and install SedFoam.
<li>Section \ref starting gives informations on how the case directory is organised. 
<li>Section \ref governing describes sedFoam governing equations. 
<li>Section \ref algoSedFoam describes sedFoam algorithm. 
<li>Section \ref tutorials_1d describes the 1D tutorials provided with SedFoam sources including postprocessing using a python toolbox also provided with the source and the expected results.
<li>Section \ref tutorials_2d3d describes the 2D and 3D tutorials provided with SedFoam sources
<li>Section \ref pulicationList list of publications using sedFoam
<li>Section \ref inputs describes the input parameters for SedFoam 
<li>Section \ref howtogit provides a survival guide on how to use git to use/develop sedFoam
<li>Section \ref faq provides answers to typical Frequently Asked Questions about SedFoam 
</ul>


The second part provides informations for developers.
