First go to the 
<a href="http://github.com/sedfoam/sedfoam/">official SedFoam page</a>
to get the latest distribution, if you have not downloaded SedFoam already.

\section install_src_unix Compiling from source with OpenFOAM-5.0

You need at least OpenFOAM-5.0 (or OpenFOAM-v1806) to build the executable:
<ul>
<li>First go to the <a href="http://openfoam.org/version/5-0/">download</a> page of the software
<li><a href="https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation/Linux/OpenFOAM-5.0">Install OpenFOAM-5.0</a>.
</ul>

To take full advantage of SedFoam the following additional tools should be installed.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/swak4Foam">swak4Foam</A> extension combines many fonctionalities and is needed for the tutorials
<li>the python package
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sedfoam/fluidfoam">fluidfoam</A>
    is needed for postprocessing of the tutorials. 
</ul>

Compilation is now done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Download the official SedFoam package:
   
        git clone http://github.com/sedfoam/sedfoam

<li>Compile the program by running Allwmake:

        cd sedfoam
        source $FOAM_ETC/bashrc # load the openfoam environment
        ./Allwmake

    The program should compile without problems and the binary
    <code>sedFoam_rbgh</code> and associated libraries
    should be available in the $FOAM_USER_APPBIN and $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN directories.

<li>Optional: Generate the user manual.
    
        cd doc
        make html

    To let doxygen generate the HTML documentation.
    
    The HTML directory within the build directory will now contain the html
    documentation (just point a HTML browser to the file
    <code>index.html</code> in the html directory). 
    
</ol>

\section install_src_unix_foamext Compiling from source with FOAM-extend release 4.0

First we need to add a tailored fixedFluxPressureFvPatchScalarField class : myfixedFluxPressureFvPatchScalarField.
The source files are available in foam_ext_add directory.

Finally some modifications of the sources are necessary : 
<ul>
<li>'''constant::mathematical::pi''' must be replace by '''mathematicalConstant::pi''' in all source directories:

        find solver -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/constant::mathematical::pi/mathematicalConstant::pi/g'
        find turbulenceModels -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/constant::mathematical::pi/mathematicalConstant::pi/g'

<li> In solver/sedFoam.C : readTimeControls.H must be replace by createTimeControls.H
<li> In solver/sedFoam.C : rasModelb->kMin() and rasModelb->omegaMin() must be replace by rasModelb->k0() and rasModelb->omega0()
<li> In solver/sedFoam.C : uncomment foam_ext part (around fixedFluxPressureFvPatchScalarField call) and update Make/options file of solver directory (add myfiniteVolume include directory)
<li> In solver/pEqn.H : the  ddtCorr calls must be replace by ddtphiCorr as suggested in the file pEqn.H
<li> 
</ul>

Next compile the program by running make:

        cd SedFoam-master
        source $FOAM_ETC/bashrc # load the openfoam environment
        ./Allwmake
	
\note The cyclic boundary condition is similar but not identical in foam-extend. So tutorials must be modified for foam-extend support.
