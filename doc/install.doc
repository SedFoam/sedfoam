\section install_src_unix Compiling from source with supported OpenFOAM (last ESI version)

You need OpenFOAM-v2012 to build the executable.
<ul>
<li>First go to the <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/download">download</a> page of the software
<li><a href="https://www.openfoam.com/download/installation.php">Install OpenFOAM</a>.
</ul>

To take full advantage of SedFoam the following additional tools should be installed.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/swak4Foam">swak4Foam</A> extension combines many fonctionalities and is needed for the tutorials
<li>the python package
    <a href="https://github.com/fluiddyn/fluidfoam">fluidfoam</A>
    is needed for postprocessing of the tutorials. 
</ul>

Compilation is now done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Download the official SedFoam package:
   
        git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/sedfoam/sedfoam

<li>Compile the program by running Allwmake:

        cd sedfoam
        source $FOAM_ETC/bashrc # load the openfoam environment
        ./Allwmake

    The program should compile without problems and the binary
    <code>sedFoam_rbgh</code> and associated libraries
    should be available in the $FOAM_USER_APPBIN and $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN directories.

</ol>
