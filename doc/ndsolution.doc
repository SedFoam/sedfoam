\tableofcontents{xml:1}

In this chapter we propose a non-dimensional formulation of the two-phase sediment transport equations and we show the necessary steps required in order to obtain a non-dimensional solution. First the governing equations in their non-dimensional form are presented. Afterward we demonstrate how to perform some of the SedFoam tutorials simulations using the non-dimensional formulation.

\section nd_gov_eq Non-dimensional governing equations

The non-dimensional formulation of the two-phase flow equations starts with the selection of characteristic quantities. In particular, a characteristic length and a characteristic velocity scale need to be selected. For example, in the case of a turbulent flow in an open channel, the channel height \f$x_c=H\f$ and the friction velocity \f$u_c=u_{\tau}\f$, are usually selected. A characteristic timescale can then also be obtained as \f$t_c=H/u_{\tau}\f$. The non-dimensional formulation of the turbulence-averaged two-phase flow governing equations is presented below. The characteristic quantities of the open channel flow are used in the derivation of the non-dimensional equations for the shake of convenience. Non-dimensional quantities are marked with an asterisk. The closure models for particle–particle interaction, flow turbulence, and turbulence–sediment interaction terms are those presented in the *Governing equations* section of this guide. For more details the interested reader is also referred to <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/4367/2017/">Chauchat et al. (2017)</a>. 


The non-dimensional mass conservation equations for the particle phase and the fluid phase are written as:

\f[
\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \beta u_i^{*b}}{\partial x_i^*} = 0
\f]


\f[
\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \alpha u_i^{*a}}{\partial x_i^*} = 0
\f]

where \f$x^*=x/H\f$, \f$u^*=u/u_{\tau}\f$ and \f$t^*=tu_{\tau}/H\f$. 


The non-dimensional momentum equations for particle and fluid phases can be written as:

\f[
\frac{\partial \alpha u_i^{*a}}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \alpha u_i^{*a} u_j^{*a}}{\partial x_j^*} = - \frac{\alpha}{\rho^*} \frac{\partial p^*}{\partial x_i^*} - \frac{1}{\rho^*} \frac{\partial(p^{*ff} + p^{*a})}{\partial x_i^*} + \frac{1}{\rho^*} \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}^{*a}}{\partial x_j^*} + \frac{\alpha g_i^*}{Fr^2} + \frac{1}{\rho^*} \alpha \beta K^* (u_i^{*b} - u_i^{*a}) - \frac{S_{US}}{\rho^*} \beta K^* {C_\mu} \frac{k^{*2}}{\epsilon^*} \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x_i^*}
\f]


\f[
\frac{\partial \beta u_i^{*b}}{\partial t^*} + \frac{\partial \beta u_i^{*b} u_j^{*b}}{\partial x_j^*} = - \beta \frac{\partial p^*}{\partial x_i^*} + \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}^{*b}}{\partial x_j^*} + \frac{\beta g_i^*}{Fr^2} - \alpha \beta K^* (u_i^{*b} - u_i^{*a}) + S_{US} \beta K^* {C_\mu} \frac{k^{*2}}{\epsilon^*} \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x_i^*}
\f]


where

\f[
p^{*ff} = C^*_{Fr} \frac{(\alpha - \alpha^{min})^{\eta_0}}{( \alpha^{max} - \alpha)^{\eta_1}}
\f]


\f[
p^{*a} = \rho^* \left( \frac{B_\phi \alpha}{\alpha^{max}-\alpha} \right)^2 d^{*2} ||\overline{\overline{S^{*a}}}||^2
\f]


\f[
\tau_{ij}^{*a} = \left[ \mu_S + \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_S}{I_0 B_\phi \alpha} (\alpha^{max}-\alpha) \right] \frac{S_{ij}^{*a}}{\sqrt{2(S_{ij}^{*a} \cdot S_{ij}^{*a})}} (p^{*ff} + p^{*a})
\f]


\f[
K^* = \frac{18}{Re_p} \left(1 + 0.15 Re_p^{0.687}\right) \frac{\|\mathbf{u}^{*b} - \mathbf{u}^{*a}\|}{\rho^* d^* \psi} \beta^{-h_{\text{exp}}}
\f]


\f[
Re_p = \beta \|\mathbf{u}^{*b} - \mathbf{u}^{*a}\| d^* \psi Re_\tau
\f]


\f[
\tau_{ij}^{*b} = 2 C_\mu \frac{k^{*2}}{\epsilon^*} S_{ij}^{*b} + \frac{2}{Re_\tau} \left[ 1 + 2.5 \alpha \left( 1 - \frac{\alpha}{\alpha^{max}} \right)^{-1} \right] S_{ij}^{*b} - \frac{2}{3} k^*
\f]


with \f$p^* = p /(\rho^b u_\tau^2)\f$ the non-dimensional pressure, \f$C^*_{Fr} = C_{Fr} / (\rho^b u_\tau^2)\f$ the non-dimensional counterpart of the coefficient in the permanent particle contact model, \f$g^*\f$ the unit vector in the direction of gravity, \f$k^* = k / u_\tau^2\f$ the non-dimensional turbulent kinetic energy and \f$\epsilon^* = \epsilon H / u_\tau^3\f$ the non-dimensional turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate. The following additional non-dimensional parameters appear in the above equations: the Reynolds number, \f$Re_\tau = H u_\tau / \nu^b\f$ describing the ratio between inertia and viscous forces, the Froude number, \f$Fr = u_\tau / \sqrt{g H}\f$ describing the ratio between inertia and gravity forces, the non-dimensional particle diameter, \f$d^* = d / H\f$ and the ratio between particle and fluid phase density, \f$\rho^* = \rho^a / \rho^b\f$. In this way, the general sediment transport turbulent flow problem is reduced to the minimum set of independent parameters. Indeed, according to Buckingham \f$\pi\f$ theorem the parameter space of the problem is reduced from the original dimensional N = 7: \f$f(H, u_\tau, \rho^b, \eta^b, g, d, \rho^\alpha)\f$ to the M = 7 - 3 = 4: \f$g(Re_\tau, Fr, \rho^*, d^*)\f$ non-dimensional parameter space. Note that other non-dimensional groups can be used to describe sediment transport in turbulent flow instead of the above four, however any additional non-dimensional group will necessarily be a dependent parameter of this original set of four. For example, the following non-dimensional groups can also be defined (among others): Stokes number, \f$Stk = \rho^* Re_\tau d^{*2} / 18\f$ (assuming a Stokes flow regime) describing the ratio between particle response time and characteristic time scale of the flow, Suspension number \f$S = (\rho^* - 1) Re_\tau d^* / {(18 Fr^2)}\f$ (assuming a Stokes flow regime) describing the ratio between the particle settling velocity and the characteristic velocity of the flow and Shields number \f$\theta = Fr^2 / [(\rho^* - 1) d^*]\f$ describing the ratio between forces acting to mobilize sediment particles on a bed to the resisting forces due to the particle's weight.


\section nd_tutorials Non-dimensional solution tutorials

The following tutorials show how to run the sedFOAM tutorials in order to obtain a non-dimensional instead of a dimensional solution. Note that there is no required modification in the flow solver. The parameters in the input files only need to be modified in such a way as to obtain the corresponding non-dimensional terms in the mass and momentum equations. The non-dimensional version of three of the original sedFOAM tutorials is demonstrated below. Namely: *1DSedim: Pure sedimentation*, *1DSheetFlow: Turbulent sheet-flows* and *3DChannel560: Turbulent channel flow laden with particles*. In the following, only the lines that require modification in the corresponding input files of the tutorials are presented. For more details about the set-up and execution of these tutorials the reader is referred to the original version of the tutorials in this guide.
