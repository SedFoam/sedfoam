In this chapter multi-dimensional test cases are presented to illustrate the full SedFoam capabilities to deal with complex geometries as well as to provide configuration files to allow for the development of new configurations. 

\section ScourApron 2DScour: Scour downstream of an apron

In this 2D configuration, we are looking at the scour development downstream of an apron. Following the numerical study of Amoudry & Liu (2009) and Cheng et al. (2017), the scour problem
is simplified and sketched in figure 1.


\subsection preprocSA Pre-processing

This tutorial is distributed with SedFoam under the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/2DScourApron*.

\subsection meshgenSA Mesh generation

The numerical domain consists of a rectangle of side length L = 0.5 m in the x-y plane and of height h=0.25 m in the vertical direction z, where the flow depth is chosen to be  \f$h_0\f$ = 0.15m, and
the initial bed depth is  \f$h_b\f$ = 0.05m. A regular grid is used in the vertical direction for the sediment bed (50 elements along the vertical direction) and in horizontal direction (250 elements). Inside the water column, 100 grid points are used with an increasing cell ratio of 2 along the vertical direction. Please note that this coarse mesh is for tutorial purpose only. If you want a finer mesh you may refer to Chauchat et al. (2017). The block structure is shown in Figure 9.

\subsection  BC_initiSA Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, as for the previous 1D tutorials the initial fields data are stored in the 0_org sub-directory of the case directory.

The bottom boundary, the lower part of the inlet (forming the step) and of the outlet are set as wall boundaries. The upper part of the inlet is an inlet boundary where the velocity profile is imposed according to the rough wall log law (eq. (73) in Chauchat et al. (2017)) via the GroovyBC utility. Turbulent quantities are imposed as constant values following recommendation from esi group (http://www.esi-cfd.com/content/view/877/192/). At the outlet, a directionMixed boundary condition is used for the velocities of both phases (zeroGradient for streamwise component and zero value for the vertical one) and the hydrostatic pressure is imposed thanks to the GroovyBC utility. 
As initial condition, the velocity of both phases, the sediment concentration, the TKE and the TKE dissipation are set based on one-dimensional simulation results using funkySetFields. The details of the boundary conditions are summarized in the following table:

The physical property of the particles (diameter and density) and of the fluid (density and kinematic viscosity) have been set to the values given in Amoudry & Liu (2009).

For this case, the dense granular flow rheology \f$\mu(I)\f$ is used and the parameters are set according to Chauchat (2017). Furthermore a shear induced pressure (PPressureModel) and an effective fluid viscosity model (FluidViscosityModel) from Boyer et al. (2011) are used:

\subsection Disc_solvSF2 Discretisation and linear-solver settings

The numerical schemes and the solvers are the same as in the 1DSheetFlow case.

\subsection control_sedFoamSF2 Control

The system/controlDict file indicates that for this case the time step is equal to \f$ 2.10^{-5}\f$ s and that the computation ends at 60s of dynamics. The output write interval has been set to 5s by default. The user is invited to reduce it in order to capture the evolution of the scour hole more accurately. Additionally,  time step can be increased to \f$ 2.10^{-4}\f$ s after 2s to speed up the computational time.

\verbatim

\subsection  lauch_SA Computation launching

As for the previous cases, you can launch the computation by executing * Allrun *. This shell script contains two lines specific to the present multidimensional case:

\verbatim
# Decompose the case in order to run in parallel (on 4 cores)
decomposePar

# Run sedFoam_rbgh in parallel
mpirun -np 4 sedFoam_rbgh -parallel > log&
\endverbatim
First of all, as the mesh is composed of 37500 cells, computation runs faster on several processors (the best compromise is around 10000 cells per core). Here, the *decomposePar* command decompose the initial time (specified in the *controlDict* file) in the number of part specified in the *system/decomposeParDict* file.

The second command specify that the computation is launched in parallel with *mpirun*.

\subsection postSF2 Post-processing using python

You just have to run the python script *plot_tuto2DScour.py* located in the folder *tutorials/Py*:

\verbatim
python plot_tuto2DScour.py
\endverbatim

and you should see the following figures:

\section Scour2DCylinder 2DPipelineScour: Scour around an horizontal cylinder

In this tutorial, the experimental configuration investigating scour under a submarine pipeline from Mao (1986) is reproduced numerically.

\subsection preprocSP Pre-processing

This tutorial is distributed with SedFoam under the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/2DPipelineScour*.

\subsection meshgen_SP Mesh generation

The numerical domain dimensions presented in figure 4. A cylinder of diameter \f$ D=5cm \f$ is placed 15 diameters away from the inlet. The overall domain dimensions were 35 diameters long and 6.1 diameters high. The mesh is generated using the OpenFOAM utilities blockMesh and snappyHexMesh. The mesh generated with blockMesh is a simple rectangle with regular grid spacing excepted in the vertical direction where cells are expanding toward the top boundary. The snappyHexMesh utility uses the file Cyl.stl located in the constant/triSurface directory containing the cylinder geometry to remove mesh cells inside it, add layers of cells around the cylinder and refine cells in regions of high concentration gradient at the bed. 

@image html "sketch_2DPipelineScour.png" "Figure 4: Sketch of the scour under a submarine pipeline." width=600px
@image latex "sketch_2DPipelineScour.png" "Figure 4: Sketch of the scour under a submarine pipeline."

Depending on the turbulence model used, the number of layers should not be the same to accurately predict the boundary layer around the cylinder. The default snappyHexMeshDict in the system directory is written to perform simulations using the \f$ k-\omega \f$ turbulence model. For simulations using the \f$ k-\varepsilon \f$ model, the user should use/rename the file snappyHexMeshDict_kEpsilon located in the system directory to generate the mesh.

\subsection  BC_init_SP Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, as for the previous tutorials the initial fields data are stored in the 0_org sub-directory of the case directory.

The top boundary condition is a symmetryPlane. The outlet pressure is set to 0. The outlet boundary condition for the velocity is inletOulet corresponding to a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition for outgoing flows and a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition for incoming flows. The inlet is decomposed into two parts. From the bottom to \f$ y = 1.5D \f$, a wall-type boundary condition is applied. From \f$ y = 1.5D \f$ to the top, a rough wall log law velocity profile is used following the expression \f$ u_x(y) = \frac{u_*}{\kappa}ln\left(\frac{30y}{k_s}\right)  \f$

with \f$ u_*=0.04318m/s \f$ the bottom friction velocity, \f$ \kappa=0.41 \f$ the von Karman constant and \f$ k_s=2.5d \f$ the Nikuradse roughness length. The velocity is increased linearly during the first 4 seconds of the simulation. Inlet values for turbulent quantities were set following \f$ k = 10 \times 10^{-4} \overline U \f$, \f$ \varepsilon = k^{3/2} /0.1 h \f$ and \f$ \omega = k^{1/2} /0.1 C_\mu h \f$ with \f$ \overline U=0.87m/s \f$ the bulk velocity, \f$ h \f$ the distance from the bed to the top boundary and \f$ C_\mu=0.09 \f$ an empirical constant.

The sediment bed is initialised using the expression \f$ \alpha_{Init}=0.6128*0.5*\left[1+tanh\left(-\dfrac{0.026+y}{0.001}\right)\right] \f$.

The physical property of the particles (diameter and density) and of the fluid (density and kinematic viscosity) have been set to the values given in Mao (1986).

\subsection  lauch_SP Computation launching

\subsection post_SP Post-processing using python

The post-processing python scripts plot_profiles2DPipelineScour.py and plot_depth2DPipelineScour.py are located in the folder tutorials/Py.

The script _profiles2DPipelineScour.py plots bed profiles at 11s, 18s and 25s compared with experimental data like in the following figure:

\section  wetvalanche2D 2DWetAvalancheMuIv: Immersed granular avalanche


We consider a layer of granular material fully immersed in a viscous liquid. The granular layer
is inclined so it starts moving down a planar slope as illustrated in figure 7.  
The  geometrical  parameters  and  boundary  conditions  are  set  to reproduce precisely the experimental setup of Pailha et al.(2008).
 In this example, the dense granular flow rheology \f$\mu(I_v)\f$ is considered.
Additionally, dilatancy effects are included to better reproduce  the initial dynamics of the  granular flow.  Iverson et al.(2000) showed the  initial dynamics of underwater avalanches strongly 
depend on the initial volume fraction: initially loose granular beds are  instantaneously mobilized after tilting the plane whereas
in initially dense granular beds, the motion of the avalanche is delayed. This mechanism is accompanied by an expansion (initially dense) or contraction  (initially loose)
of the granular medium that modifies the pore space.  Consequently,  negative (dense packings) or positive (loose packings)
 excess  pore pressures develop within the mixture. In this example, we
 reproduce a dense granular avalanche \f$(\phi_0=0.592)\f$  in 2D. In order to reach an initial equilibrium state, 
 200 seconds are required to let the granular layer deposit by gravity. In order to save up some computational time, the deposition process
 is carried out in a 1D simulation in the *Reference1D* directory.

\subsection preprocSA Pre-processing

This tutorial is distributed with SedFoam under the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/2DWetAvalanche*.


\subsection sediment1DwetAva 1D Deposition process

The 1D sedimentation test can be launched by executing *Allrun* in the *Reference1D* directory. 


If you want a different initial volume fraction you need to adjust the *0_org/alphaPlastic* file accordingly. 
Reference values: *alphaPlastic=0.575* leads to \f$\phi_0=0.592\f$, *alphaPlastic=0.545* leads to \f$\phi_0=0.571\f$ 
and *alphaPlastic=0.520* leads to \f$\phi_0=0.566\f$.



\subsection meshgen2DAvalanche Mesh generation

The numerical domain consists of a rectangle of side length \f$L = 1m\f$ in the x-z plane and height \f$H = 0.07m\f$ in the vertical direction. 
The initial bed depth is  \f$h = 0.0049m\f$. The mesh consists of 1000 elements  in the horizontal direction and 70  elements in  the vertical direction.
The meshing utility *snappyHexMesh* is  executed to generate a finer mesh in regions of high concentration.
 

The meshing and refinement  process are generated by running:

\verbatim
blockMesh
snappyHexMesh -overwrite
extrudeMesh
\endverbatim


\subsection  BC_initi2DAvalanche Boundary and initial conditions

Unlike previous tutorials, this case is set up to start at time t = 200s, time enough to reproduce an initially 
dense granular bed by a 1D deposition  test.
The initial fields are retrieved from *Reference1D* directory and transformed to the new 2D geometry  by means of the *mapFields* utility:



\verbatim
# create the initial time folder
cp -r 0_org 200

# Initialize fields
mapFields -sourceTime 200 Reference1D
\endverbatim


In order to reproduce the experimental setup of Pailha et al. (2008), all the x-y plane  boundaries are set as wall boundaries. 
The velocities of both phases are set to zero at all boundaries  (lateral, top and bottom) while  a  *fixedFluxPressure* condition is 
imposed for the excess pore pressure on all boundaries. 
A homogeneous Neumann boundary condition (zero gradient) is imposed for all the other quantities.



\subsection PhysProp2DAvalanche Physical properties


The following variables are considered to reproduce the experimental results of Pailha et al. (2008):

\subsection  lauch_2DwetAvalanche Computation launching

Like in previous case, you can launch the computation by executing *Allrun*. The simulations will run in parallel on 18 cores.

\verbatim
# Decompose the case and run in parallel 
decomposePar
mpirun -np 18 sedFoam_rbgh -parallel > log&
\endverbatim


\subsection postAvalanche2D Post-processing using python

You just have to run the python script *plot_tuto2DWetAvalanche.py* located in the folder *tutorials/Py*:

\verbatim
python plot_tuto2DWetAvalanche.py
\endverbatim

and you should see the following figures:



@image html "2DWetAvalancheResults.png" "Figure 8: a) Evolution of surface particle velocity and b) excess of pore pressure with time. Experimental curves are extracted from Pailha et al.(2008)." width=800px
@image latex "2DWetAvalancheResults.png" "Figure 8: a) Evolution of surface particle velocity and b) excess of pore pressure with time. Experimental curves are extracted from Pailha et al.(2008)."
