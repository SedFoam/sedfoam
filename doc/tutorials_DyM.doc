In this chapter we shall describe in detail the process of setup, simulation and post-processing for SedFoam test cases using dynamic meshes. All the tutorial cases are located in the *tutorialsDyM* directory.


\section  PrerequisitesInst Installation Prerequisites



Before launching any numerical simulation, make sure overSedDymFoam_rbgh is correctly installed and compiled. In case you are only interested in running dynamic mesh cases, the compilation is done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>First, download the overSedDymFoam_rbgh branch:

        git clone -b overSedDyMFoam https://github.com/puigmontella/sedfoam.git

<li>Compile the program by running Allwmake:

        cd sedfoam
        source $FOAM_ETC/bashrc # load the openfoam environment
        ./Allwmake

    The program should compile without problems and the binary
    <code>overSedDymFoam_rbgh</code> and associated libraries
    should be available in the $FOAM_USER_APPBIN and $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN directories.

</ol>

To take full advantage of SedFoam and be able to run the postprocessing scripts make sure Python is installed. Python usually comes pre-installed in Linux. However, if not installed or if you need a specific version, you can install Python with the following command:
<code> sudo apt install python3 <code>


Further details can be found in section \ref install .

\section  FallingSphereOverset_testcase FallingSphereOverset: Falling sphere in pure fluid using an overset  approach

In this tutorial, we study the free fall of a sphere with a diameter \f$D=15mm\f$ settling in silicon oil using the overset approach. The experimental setup consists of a rectangular box measuring  \f$100 \times 100 \times 160mm\f$ (click <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/14/11/4012/1008754/Particle-imaging-velocimetry-experiments-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext">here</a> to go to the article associated to this experiment) . The input parameters have been chosen to reproduce the experiments of a settling sphere at a Reynolds number equal to \f$Re=W^{obj}D/\nu^f=1.5\f$, where \f$W^{obj}\f$ is the terminal velocity of the sphere.   The  numerical case can be found in the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset*. This benchmark is inspired by the
<a href="https://wiki.openfoam.com/Settling_Sphere_by_Michael_Alletto">online tutorial of a settling sphere of OpenFOAM</a>. The physical parameters are summarized in  the following table:


<table>
<caption id="multi_row">Main physical parameters.</caption>
<tr><th>Properties   <th>Value
<tr><td>Sphere density   <td>\f$\rho^{obj}= 1120 \frac{kg}{m^3}\f$
<tr><td>Fluid density    <td>\f$\rho^f=970 \frac{kg}{m^3}\f$
<tr><td>Fluid viscosity     <td>\f$\nu^f=3.845  \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{m^2}{s}\f$
<tr><td>Sphere diameter   <td>\f$D=0.015 m\f$

\subsection MeshFallingSphereOverset Mesh generation and setup


The numerical domain consists of two disconnected meshes. The background mesh, which remains static throughout the simulation, is a hexahedron with a side length of  \f$6.66 D\f$, while the overset mesh that moves relative to the background mesh is a hexahedron with a side length of \f$2.5 D\f$. These meshes are illustrated in Figure 1


@image html "sketchFallingSphere_overset.png" "Figure 1: Geometrical domain for the falling sphere using an overset mesh." width=400px
@image latex "sketchFallingSphere_overset.png" "Figure 1: Geometrical domain for the falling sphere using an overset mesh."



The overset mesh is generated by running the command *blockMesh* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereMesh* folder. Then, the meshing utility *snappyHexMesh* is  executed to generate a finer mesh near the spherical object.
The meshing, refinement  process and scale transformation are generated by running:


\verbatim
blockMesh
snappyHexMesh -overwrite
transformPoints -scale '0.0075'
\endverbatim




Finally, *topoSet* needs to be executed to add the moving cells. Alternatively, one can execute *./Allrun.pre* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereMesh* folder to generate the overset mesh.

Afterwards, we need to generate the background mesh and merge the two meshes. To do so, we will execute the *./Allrun.pre* command in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereAndBackground* folder. By running *./Allrun.pre*  we are executing a sequence of several commands that we can break down here one by one to understand their meaning:

\verbatim
blockMesh
topoSet -dict system/topoSetDictR2
refineMesh -dict system/refineMeshDict2 -overwrite
\endverbatim


The mesh is generated, and *topoSet* and *refineMesh* are called to refine the mesh along the vertical direction of the sphere trajectory. The refinement in this vertical region is carried out to reduce the interpolation errors between the background mesh and the overset mesh around the sphere. Then,

\verbatim
mergeMeshes . ../sphereMesh -overwrite
topoSet
\endverbatim

The sphere is added into our setup and *topoSet* is executed to select cellSets for the different zones.

In the last part of Allrun.pre script, we create the initial time folder and use cellSets to write zoneID. Each cell zone, indicated in the zoneID field, should have a different zone id. In our case, there are two zones: the zoneID cells of the background mesh are set to 0 while zoneID cells belonging to the overset mesh are set to 1:

\subsection  DyMesh_SphereFallOverset Dynamic mesh

Mesh changes are only possible if we have a file called *dynamicMeshDict* in the constant folder. Several mesh options and controls can be adjusted in the *dynamicMeshDict* dictionary. In this file we need to specify that the motion solver (in our case *sixDoFRigidBodyMotionSedFoam*), the *patch* where the 6DoF is acting, and set the moment of inertia and the apparent mass of the object. The 6DoF solver integrates the viscous, frictional, granular and excess of fluid pressure forces over the *patch* to get the velocity and displacement of the sphere.

The simulations will run in parallel on 4 cores by executing the following commands at *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereAndBackground* folder:

\verbatim
decomposePar
mpirun -np 4 overSedDymFoam_rbgh -parallel > log.out&
\endverbatim

One can skip all the previous steps and simply run the command *./Allrun* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset* folder. It is worth mentioning that the output data will be stored in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereAndBackground* folder.



\subsection postFallingSphereOverset Post-processing using python


You just have to run the python script *plot3DFallingSphere.py* located in the folder *tutorialsDyM/Py*. Make sure that the chosen mesh in the script is set to DynamycMesh="Overset".



\verbatim
python plot3DFallingSphere.py
\endverbatim

and you should see the following figure that shows the trajectory and velocity of the sphere falling in a pure fluid using the overset technique:

\section  FallingSphereMorph_testcase FallingSphereMorphing: Falling sphere in pure fluid using a morphing mesh




This numerical test investigates the same falling sphere presented in the previous case using a morphing mesh instead of the overset technique. The numerical case is located at *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereMorphing*.

\subsection MeshFallingSphereMorph Mesh generation and setup


The numerical domain consists of a spherical mesh  with a diameter of \f$13.3D\f$. This type of mesh can deform, but the connectivity between the cells remains unchanged. The mesh is illustrated in Figure 3.

@image latex "sketchFallingSphere_morphing.png" "Figure 3: Geometrical domain for the falling sphere using a morphing mesh."


The spherical mesh is generated by running the command *blockMesh* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereMorphing* folder.


\subsection  DyMesh_SphereFallMorph Dynamic mesh

Several mesh options and controls can be adjusted in the dynamicMeshDict dictionary located in the constant folder. For morphing meshes, the dynamicMotionSolverFvMesh solver is employed to modify the mesh topology around a rigid object. The mesh region around the rigid body is divided into three parts: the region where the mesh moves with the rigid body, the mesh morphing region, and the outer region that remains static.

The mesh region around the rigid body is divided into three parts: the region where the mesh moves with the rigid body, the mesh morphing region and the outer region that remains static. The part inside the *innerDistance* is completely body motion so it does not deform, and the region between the *innerDistance* and *outerDistance*  corresponds to the mesh morphing region.

\section  FallingSphere_Susptestcase Falling sphere in a sediment suspension



In this scenario, we aim to extend the results by numerically reproducing the falling sphere in a fluid with the presence of sediments in suspension. For this numerical setup, the sediment content is set to  5\f$\%\f$, and the particles are neutrally buoyant (i.e. same density as the fluid) with a mean diameter of \f$d=0.29 mm\f$. The numerical cases are located at *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereSuspensionMorphing* and *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereSuspensionOverset*.  These two cases are just an extension of previous cases, therefore, a few modifications are required to handle the particulate phase.

\subsection  FallingSphere_Susp_physical Physical properties

In the *constant/transportProperties* file, the physical properties of the solid and fluid phases are set, such as density, kinematic viscosity and particle diameter:

After creating the initial tome folder (execute *cp -r 0_org 0*), the dense sediment bed beneath the spherical object needs to be put in place. To do so, first, we need to run the *initial_1D_profile/1DSedim* case to get the sedimentation of the granular material. Then, *mapFields* utility maps the fields (including the concentration field – alpha.a)  from the 1DSedim onto the corresponding fields for the 3D spherical geometry:

\endverbatim

One can skip all the previous steps and simply run the command *./Allrun* in the *tutorialsDyM/RestingSphereMorphing* folder to launch the numerical case.

\section  GuillardCylCase 2DCylinderUniformGranularFlow: Uniform granular flow around a cylinder

In this subsection we analyze the stresses and the trajectory of an intruder immersed in a uniform granular flow. To reduce the computational cost, we use a cylinder (a 2D object in OpenFOAM)  instead of the spherical intruder employed in previous numerical cases. Our approach is inspired by the work of  <a href="https://hal.science/hal-00997840/document">Guillard</a> , where lift and drag forces on a cylinder were measured under a granular flow. We adopt a similar setup, as depicted in Figure 8. More specifically, a granular packing is considered, then, the bottom plate is set to a prescribed constant velocity that induces a uniform granular flow above the bottom plate. Placing a cylinder in the granular medium distorts the flow patterns. As illustrated in Figure 8, a constant horizontal velocity of \f$u_o=0.01m/s\f$ is prescribed at the bottom to generate the uniform granular flow. The initial velocity field is set to \f$u_o=0.01m/s\f$ as well. DEM simulations performed using the open-source code YADE are also presented to test the accuracy of sedFoam. The employed parameters are summarized in the following table:

<tr><th>Properties   <th>Value
<tr><td>Intruder density   <td>\f$\rho^{obj}= 2500 \frac{kg}{m^3}\f$

\subsection MeshCyl Mesh generation and setup

The rectangular mesh is generated by running the command *blockMesh* in the *tutorialsDyM/2DCylinderUniformGranularFlow* folder.

\subsection  CylPhysical Physical properties

In the *constant/transportProperties* file, the physical properties of the solid and fluid phases are set, such as density, kinematic viscosity and particle diameter. It is worth noting that DEM simulations assume a dry granular material, however, the density ratio using sedFoam is slightly different to avoid numerical errors:

After creating the initial time folder (execute *cp -r 0_org 0*), the dense granular material is generated using the sediment concentration vertical profile of a one dimensional sedimentation. To do so, first, we need to run the *Case1D* case to get the sedimentation of the granular material and the correct lithostatic pressure gradient. Then, *mapFields* utility maps the fields (including the concentration field – alpha.a)  from the *Case1D* case onto the corresponding fields for the 2D rectangular geometry:

and you should see the following figure that shows the evolution of the large intruder compared to the trajectory given by  YADE simulations. As reported by <a href="https://hal.science/hal-00997840/document">Guillard</a>, the asymmetrical granular stress field results in a lift force that brings the intruder up to the surface.
