\section  FallingSphereOverset_testcase FallingSphereOverset: Falling sphere in pure fluid using an overset  approach

This tutorial we  study the free fall of a sphere with a diameter \f$D=15mm\f$ settling in silicon oil using the overset approach. The experimental setting consists in a rectangular box of \f$100 \times 100 \times 160mm\f$. The input parameters have been chosen to reproduce  the experiments of a settling sphere at Reynolds number equal to \f$Re=W^{obj}D/\nu^f=1.5\f$ CITE, where \f$W^{obj}\f$ is the terminal velocity of the sphere.   The  numerical case can be found under the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset*. This benchmark is inspired by the
<a href="https://wiki.openfoam.com/Settling_Sphere_by_Michael_Alletto">online tutorial of a settling sphere of OpenFOAM</a>. The  physical parameters are summarized in  the following table:


<table>
<caption id="multi_row">Main physical parameters.</caption>
<tr><th>Properties   <th>Value
<tr><td>Sphere density   <td>\f$\rho^{obj}= 1120 \frac{kg}{m^3}\f$
<tr><td>Fluid density    <td>\f$\rho^f=970 \frac{kg}{m^3}\f$
<tr><td>Fluid viscosity     <td>\f$\nu^f=3.845  \cdot 10^{-4} \frac{m^2}{s}\f$
<tr><td>Sphere diameter   <td>\f$D=0.015 m\f$

\subsection MeshFallingSphereOverset Mesh generation and set-up
The numerical domain consists of two disconnected meshes. The background mesh, which remains static throughout the simulation, is an hexaedron of side  \f$6.66 D\f$ while the overset mesh that moves relative to the background mesh is an hexaedron of side  \f$2.5 D\f$. These meshes are illustrated in Figure 1.
The overset mesh is generated by running the command *blockMesh* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereMesh* folder. Then, the meshing utility *snappyHexMesh* is  executed to generate a finer mesh near the spherical object.
The meshing, refinement  process and scale transformation are generated by running:

\verbatim
blockMesh
snappyHexMesh -overwrite
transformPoints -scale '0.0075'
\endverbatim

Finally, *topoSet* needs to be executed to add the moving cells CHECK

Alternatively, one can execute *./Allrun.pre* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereMesh* folder to generate the overset mesh.

Afterwards, we need to generate the background mesh and merge the two meshes. To do so, we will execute the *./Allrun.pre* command in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereAndBackground* folder. By running *./Allrun.pre*  we are executing a sequence of several commands that we can break down here one by one to understand their meaning:

\verbatim
blockMesh
topoSet -dict system/topoSetDictR2
refineMesh -dict system/refineMeshDict2 -overwrite
\endverbatim

The mesh is generated and *topoSet* and *refineMesh* are called to refine the mesh along the vertical direction of the sphere trajectory. Then,

\verbatim
mergeMeshes . ../sphereMesh -overwrite
topoSet
\endverbatim

The sphere is added into our set-up and *topoSet* is executed to select cellSets for the different zones COMPLETE.

In the last part of *Allrun.pre* script we  create the intial time folder, use cellSets to write zoneID and decompose the case to run it in parallel:
\verbatim
cp -r 0.orig 0
setFields
decomposePar
\endverbatim


\subsection  DyMesh_SphereFallOverset Dynamic mesh


Several mesh options and controls can be adjusted in the *dynamicMeshDict* dictionary located at *constant* folder. In this file we need to specify that the motion solver (in our case *sixDoFRigidBodyMotionSedFoam*), the *patch* where the 6DoF is acting and set the moment of inertia and the apparent mass of the object.

The simulations will run in parallel on 4 cores by executing the following command at *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereAndBackground* folder:

\verbatim
mpirun -np 4 overSedDymFoam_rbgh -parallel > log.out&
\endverbatim

One can skip all the previous steps and simply run the command *./Allrun* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset* folder. It is worth mentioning that the output data will be stored in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereOverset/sphereAndBackground* folder.



\subsection postFallingSphereOverset Post-processing using python


You just have to run the python script *plot3DFallingSphere.py* located in the folder *tutorialsDyM/Py*. Make sure that the chosen mesh in the script is set to DynamycMesh="Overset".

\verbatim
python plot3DFallingSphere.py
\endverbatim

and you should see the following figures:








\section  FallingSphereMorph_testcase FallingSphereMorphing: Falling sphere in pure fluid using a morphing mesh

This numerical test investigates the same falling sphere presented in the previous case using a morphing mesh instead of the overset technique. The numerical case is located at *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereMorphing*.

\subsection MeshFallingSphereMorph Mesh generation and set-up


The numerical domain consists of a spherical mesh  with a diameter of \f$13.3D\f$. This type of mesh can deform but the connectivity between the cells remains unchanged. The mesh is illustrated in Figure ?.
The spherical mesh is generated by running the command *blockMesh* in the *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereMorphing* folder. Then *topoSet* needs to be executed to add the moving cells CHECK.

*topoSet* and *setFields* are executed to select cellSets for the different zones COMPLETE.


\subsection  DyMesh_SphereFallMorph Dynamic mesh


Several mesh options and controls can be adjusted in the *dynamicMeshDict* dictionary located at *constant* folder.  For morphing meshes *dynamicMotionSolverFvMesh* solver is employed to modify the mesh topology around a rigid object.  The mesh region around the rigid body is divided into three parts: the region where the mesh moves with the rigid body, the mesh morphing region and the outer region that remains static. The part inside the *innerDistance* is completely body motion and the region between the *innerDistance* and *outerDistance*  corresponds to the mesh morphing region.

\section  FallingSphere_Susptestcase Falling sphere in a sediment suspension


In this scenario we want to extend the results by reproducing, numerically, the falling sphere in a fluid with the presence of sediments in suspension. For this numerical set-up, the content of sediments is set to 5\f$\%\f$, the particles are neutrally buoyant (i.e. same density as the fluid) with a mean diameter of \f$d=0.29 mm\f$. The numerical cases are located at *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereSuspensionMorphing* and *tutorialsDyM/FallingSphereSuspensionOverset*.  These two cases are just an extension of previous cases, therefore, a few modifications are required to handle the particulate phase.

\subsection  FallingSphere_Susp_physical Physical properties

In the *constant/transportProperties* file, the physical properties of the solid and fluid phases are set, such as density, kinematic viscosity and particle diameter:
