In this chapter multi-dimensional test cases are presented to illustrate the full SedFoam capabilities to deal with complex geometries as well as to provide configuration files to allow for the development of new configurations.


\section BoundaryLayer 1DBoundaryLayer: Single-phase turbulent boundary layer flow

In this test case, tturbulence model k-omega (Wilcox, 1988) is validated for a single-phase boundary layer flow over a smooth surface. The numerical results are compared with the DNS results of Moser et al. (1999).  A water column of dimensionless height \f$h=1\f$ is moving over a flat plate driven by a pressure gradient imposed along the x-axis. In this configuation, there are no sediments and the volumetric concentration of particles is set to alpha=0. A sketch of the 1D vertical computational domain is presented below:

This tutorial is distributed with sedFoam under the folder sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/RAS/1DBoundaryLayer.

The domain is divided in 64 elements, with a cell expansion ratio of 1.026 along the vertical direction (the ratio between the first cell and the last cell is equal to 10). For such mesh the normalized distance to the wall from the first cell is \f$z^+=z u_\tau/\nu=1\f$ with \f$u_\tau\f$ the bottom friction velocity and \f$\nu\f$ the fluid viscosity.

The physical properties are chosen to obtain a dimensionless solution with \f$\rho=1\f$, \f$\nu=1/Re=7.2727\times10^{-5}\f$. The parameters are set in the file constant/transportProperties and ar given as follows:

The boundary Reynolds number based on the friction velocity in Moser et al. (1999) is, \f$Re_\tau=u_\tau h^f/\nu=590\f$. In sedFoam the flow is driven by a pressure gradient \f$\partial P/\partial x\f$ acting as a source term in the momentum equations. The pressure gradient is calculated by integrating the fluid momentum equation along th wall-normal direction sas follows:
\f[
 \dfrac{\partial P}{\partial x} = \dfrac{\rho u_\tau^2}{h}
\f]
and written in the file *constant/forceProperties* using the keyword *gradPMEAN*.

\subsection oneBLBC Boundary conditions

The inlet and outlet boundaries are set to cyclic while the front and back boundaries are set to empty. The latter boundary condition means that the y-components are not considered by the solver (i.e. 2 velocity components only). At the top boundary, the pressure is fixed to zero and a zero gradient (\*i.e* Neumann boundary condition) is imposed on all the other quantities. At the wall, the velocity is set to zero, a zeroGradient condition is imposed for the pressure and a wall function is imposed for the TKE dissipation.

The wall function is prescribing the value of TKE dissipation \f$\omega.b\f$ at the wall to follow the analytical solution from Wilcox (1988). In this tutorial, a rough wall function is used prescribing the value of \f$\omega.b\f$ at the wall following:
\f[
 \omega_{wall} = S_r\frac{u_\tau^2}{\nu}
\f]
with \f$S_r\f$ a tuning parameter taking into account bed roughness \f$k_s\f$ as follows:
\f[
 S_r=\left\{
\begin{array}{r}
 \left(\dfrac{50}{k^+_s}\right)^2, k^+_s < 25 \\
 \dfrac{100}{k^+_s}, k^+_s \geq 25
\end{array}
 \right.

\section BedLoadTurb 1DBedloadTurb: Turbulent bedload transport

The aim of this tutorial is to explain how to use the kinetic theory to model the sediment phase in turbulent bedload transport. It is based on a comparison coupled fluid-DEM (discrete element method) simulations.  In DEM simulations, the motion of each particles is solved individually. The source code is YADE (Smilauer et al. 2015) and the coupling with the fluid phase presented in Maurin et al. (2015). The exact same fluid model is considered in both the fluid-DEM simulations and in the sedfoam simulation (mixing length) in order to focus on the granular flow modelling. Averaged quantities are computed in the DEM (volume fraction, particle velocity, granular temperature, etc.) which will be considered as a basis to compare with the sedFoam simulation. A complete description and analyses of the granular flow modeling with the kinetic theory can be found Chassagne et al. (2023).

\paragraph meshgenBLTurb Mesh generation

The numerical domain consists of a square of side length L = 0.00147 m in the x-y plane and of height h=0.147 m in the vertical direction z. The side length is chosen to ensure a unity cell aspect ratio. A uniform mesh of 1 by 1 by 120 cells will be used. The block structure is the same as for the Sedimentation test case.

The mesh is generated by running blockMesh from within the case directory:

\verbatim
blockMesh
\endverbatim

\paragraph BC_initiBLTurb Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time \f$t = 0\f$ s, again the initial field data are stored in a 0_org sub-directory of the case directory. The 0_org sub-directory contains several files: alpha.a, alphaMinFriction, alphaPlastic, U.a, U.b, p_rbgh, pa, Theta, one for each of the solid phase volume fraction (alpha.a), velocities of solid and fluid phases (U.a and U.b), the reduced pressure (p_rbgh) fields whose initial values and boundary conditions must be set. The initial profile of concentration (in alpha.a) is a hyperbolic tangent whose parameters have been compute so that the exact same amount of granular mass as in the DEM simulation is set in the sedFoam simulation. Compared with the sedimentation test case, no-slip boundary conditions are imposed for both phase velocity at the top and bottom boundaries.

\verbatim
forAll(mesh.C(), i)
{
 scalar y = mesh.C()[i].y();
        alpha_a[i] = 0.305*(1.0+tanh((12.5*0.006-y)/0.005));

The fluid and particles are submitted to gravity. This is accounted for as a pressure gradient source term in the momentum conservation equations. It corresponds to gradPMEAN in file *forceProperties* with \f$gradPMEAN = \rho^f g S_0 \f$, with \f$\rho^f=1000\f$ (kg/s), \f$g=9.81\f$ (m/s^2) and \f$S_0 = 0.05\f$. The tilt parameter is set to 1, so that the source term in the granular momentum equation is automatically set to \f$gradPMEAN = \rho^p g S_0 \f$.

In the dictionary *interfacialProperties* file the drag model from DallaValle is used (as in the DEM).

Kinetic theory will be used to compute the kinetic contributions of granular stresses. Be sure to set granularRheology to off in *granularRheologyProperties*. The *kineticTheoryProperties* file contains all information to set up thze kinetic theory model. First, particle properties have to be given, restitution coefficient \f$e=0.7\f$ and interparticle friction \f$\mu = 0.4\f$. alphaMax is the maximum packing fraction and phi is the angle of repose, below which the granular flow stops moving. This angle depends on the interparticle friction and an empirical formula to compute phi is given in Chassagne et al. (2023) (Appendix). killJ2_, allows to account for (0) or neglect (1) any transfer of fluctuating energy from the fluid to the particles. quadraticCorrectionJ1_ allows you to account for (1) or neglect (0) additional dissipation of granular temperature by the drag force, due to the quadratic nature of drag force in turbulent flows. Then you have to choose which model to use for each of the coefficient of the kinetic theory. The models used in this tutorial correspond to the model developed in Chassagne et al. (2023). The Garzo and Dufty (1999) coefficients are used for the viscosity, conductivity and pressure coefficient. The pressure coefficient of Lun et al. (1984) is the same as the one of Garzo and Dufty (1999). A saltation model can be specified (none by default). This modifies the viscosity and conductivity coefficients in the dilute part of the granular flow to account for saltation motions. In the current version of the code, only the GarzoDufty models can be coupled with a saltation model. The Chialvo & Sundaresan (2013) radial distribution function is used, and it is the only one that accounts for the effect of the interparticle friction coefficient (Chassagne et al. (2013)).

\section SheetFlow 1DSheetFlow: Turbulent sheet-flows

In this tutorial, the turbulent flow over a flat erodible bed drives sediment transport in the intense turbulent bedload tranpsort regime usually referred to as sheet-flow. The results are compared with experimental data from Revil-Baudard et al. (2015). Light-weight non-spherical PMMA particles of median diameter d=3 mm are used having a settling velocity in quiescent water of about \f$W_{fall}=0.059\f$ m/s. The averaged flow velocity is about U=0.52 m/s corresponding to a bed friction velocity of \f$u_*=0.05\f$ m/s and a dimensionless bed shear stress, the so-called Shields number \f$\theta\f$, equal to 0.44.

\section Scour2DCylinder 2DPipelineScour: Scour around an horizontal cylinder

In this tutorial, the experimental configuration investigating scour under a submarine pipeline from Mao (1986) is reproduced numerically.

\subsection preprocSP Pre-processing

This tutorial is distributed with SedFoam under the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/RAS/2DPipelineScour*.

\subsection meshgen_SP Mesh generation

The numerical domain dimensions are presented in figure 7. A cylinder of diameter \f$ D=5cm \f$ is placed 15 diameters away from the inlet. The overall domain dimensions were 35 diameters long and 6.1 diameters high. The mesh is generated using the OpenFOAM utilities blockMesh and snappyHexMesh. The mesh generated with blockMesh is a simple rectangle with regular grid spacing excepted in the vertical direction where cells are expanding toward the top boundary. The snappyHexMesh utility uses the file Cyl.stl located in the constant/triSurface directory containing the cylinder geometry to remove mesh cells inside it, add layers of cells around the cylinder and refine cells in regions of high concentration gradient at the bed.

@image html "sketch_2DPipelineScour.png" "Figure 7: Sketch of the scour under a submarine pipeline." width=600px
@image latex "sketch_2DPipelineScour.png" "Figure 7: Sketch of the scour under a submarine pipeline."

Depending on the turbulence model used, the number of layers should not be the same to accurately predict the boundary layer around the cylinder. The default snappyHexMeshDict in the system directory is written to perform simulations using the \f$ k-\omega \f$ turbulence model. For simulations using the \f$ k-\varepsilon \f$ model, the user should use/rename the file snappyHexMeshDict_kEpsilon located in the system directory to generate the mesh.

\subsection  BC_init_SP Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, as for the previous tutorials the initial fields data are stored in the 0_org sub-directory of the case directory.

The top boundary condition is a symmetryPlane. The outlet pressure is set to 0. The outlet boundary condition for the velocity is inletOulet corresponding to a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition for outgoing flows and a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition for incoming flows. The inlet is decomposed into two parts. From the bottom to \f$ y = 1.5D \f$, a wall-type boundary condition is applied. From \f$ y = 1.5D \f$ to the top, a rough wall log law velocity profile is used following the expression \f$ u_x(y) = \frac{u_*}{\kappa}ln\left(\frac{30y}{k_s}\right)  \f$

with \f$ u_*=0.04318m/s \f$ the bottom friction velocity, \f$ \kappa=0.41 \f$ the von Karman constant and \f$ k_s=2.5d \f$ the Nikuradse roughness length. The velocity is increased linearly during the first 4 seconds of the simulation. Inlet values for turbulent quantities were set following \f$ k = 10 \times 10^{-4} \overline U \f$, \f$ \varepsilon = k^{3/2} /0.1 h \f$ and \f$ \omega = k^{1/2} /0.1 C_\mu h \f$ with \f$ \overline U=0.87m/s \f$ the bulk velocity, \f$ h \f$ the distance from the bed to the top boundary and \f$ C_\mu=0.09 \f$ an empirical constant.

The sediment bed is initialised using the expression \f$ \alpha_{Init}=0.6128*0.5*\left[1+tanh\left(-\dfrac{0.026+y}{0.001}\right)\right] \f$.

\section Scour3DCylinder 3DScourCylinder: Scour around a vertical cylinder

In this tutorial, the experimental configuration from Roulund et al (2005) is reproduced numerically.

\subsection preprocS3D Pre-processing

This tutorial is distributed with SedFoam under the folder *sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/RAS/3DScour*.

A 1D boundary layer simulation needs to be run (see folder 1D and Allrun.pre) for fore information. The result of this simulations is then used to intialize the 3D configuation and to impose the inlet boundary condition.

\subsection meshgen_S3D Mesh generation

The numerical domain dimensions are presented in figure 10. A cylinder of diameter \f$ D=10cm \f$ is placed 4 diameters away from the inlet. The overall domain dimensions were 13 diameters long, 8 diameters wide and 2 diameters high. The mesh is generated using the OpenFOAM utilities blockMesh and a perl script is used to create the blockMeshDict. A sediment bed layer having a thickness of D/4 is initially set-up except around the cylinder where a scour pit is created with a thickness D and a radius of 2D.  The sediments are made of medium sand with median diameter d =0.26 mm and density \f$ \rho_s = 2650 \ kg.m^{-3} \f$, the corresponding fall velocity of an individual grain in quiescent water is \f$ w_{fall}=3.4 \ 10^{-2}m/s \f$. The Shields parameter at the inlet and the Reynolds number are the same as is in Roulund et al. (2005), \f$ \theta = 0.19 \f$ and \f$ Re_D = 4.6 \ 10^4 \f$, respectively. For the sand layer, outside the scour pit, the mesh is composed of 100 vertical levels having a geometric distribution with a common ratio \f$ r_s=1.025\f$. In the scour pit, an additional 100 grid points are used with a geometric common ratio \f$ r_{pit}=1.010\f$.

The mesh is generated using the perl script 'generateMeshDict_cyl_3dsedim.pl' using the folowing command:

\verbatim
perl generateMeshDict_cyl_3dsedim.pl 0.4 -0.025 0.0 0.2 -0.1 0.4 1.2 0.8
\endverbatim

See the perl script for details about the different parameters.

@image latex "sketch_3DScour.png" "Figure 10: Sketch of the scour around a vertical cylinder."

\subsection  BC_init_S3D Boundary and initial conditions

The boundary conditions have to be adapted from the RB case :

(i) At the inlet, vertical profiles obtained from a 1D vertical simulation are imposed for \f$ u^s, u^f , k , \omega.b, \alpha.a\f$. Zero transverse velocity is prescribed.

(ii) At the outlet, Neumann boundary conditions are specified for all quantities, except for the pressure for which a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed for the reduced pressure. For the velocities, a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is used when the velocity vector points outside of the domain at the outlet, and a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition is used otherwise.

(iii) At the top and side boundaries, the same boundary conditions as in the Rigid-Bed case are used.

(iv) At the walls (including the cylinder), zero velocity (no-slip) is imposed for the three components and a small value is imposed for the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) k.b. The boundary condition for \f$\omega.b\f$ is specified using the classical wall function from openFOAM at the cylinder and using a constant value is imposed at the bottom.
