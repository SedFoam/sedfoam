This directory contains the essential information to reproduce a dense granular avalanche (phi_0=0.592) in 1D. In order to reach an initial equilibrium state, 200 seconds are required to let the granular layer deposit by gravity.  After 200 seconds of sedimentation, 
the file constant/g should be adjusted to reproduce the inclined plane (25 degrees slope). Then, the 1D granular avalanche is launched running sedFoam_rbgh > log&

If you wish a different initial volume fraction you need to adjust the 0_org/alphaPlastic file accordingly. Reference values: alphaPlastic=0.575 leads to phi_0=0.592, alphaPlastic=0.545 leads to phi_0=0.571 and alphaPlastic=0.520 leads to phi_0=0.566.

A Python script for post-processing is available in "tutorial/Py" folder. The Python script requires the fluidfoam package to be installed and it is freely available at https://github.com/fluiddyn/fluidfoam .
