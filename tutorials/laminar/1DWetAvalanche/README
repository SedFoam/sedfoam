This directory contains the essential information to reproduce a dense granular avalanche (phi_0=0.592) in 1D. In order to reach an initial equilibrium state, 200 seconds are required to let the granular layer deposit by gravity.  During the sedimentation phase the dilatancy effects must be turned off (K_dila=0 in constant/granularRheologyProperties file). After 200 seconds of sedimentation, the file constant/g should be adjusted to reproduce the inclined plane (25 degrees slope) and the endTime should be changed to 800s . Additionally, dilatancy effects should be activated by setting K_dila=4 in constant/granularRheologyProperties file. Then, the 1D granular avalanche is launched running sedFoam_rbgh > log&

If you wish a different initial volume fraction you need to adjust the 0_org/alphaPlastic file accordingly. Reference values: alphaPlastic=0.575 leads to phi_0=0.592, alphaPlastic=0.545 leads to phi_0=0.571 and alphaPlastic=0.520 leads to phi_0=0.566. It is worth noting that numerical simulations performed in the article "A two-fluid model for immersed granular avalanches with dilatancy effects
Puig Montell√†, Eduard; Chauchat, Julien; Chareyre, Bruno; Bonamy, Cyrille; Hsu, Tian-Jian" are conducted with a finer mesh. To reproduce their same results the mesh size should be adjusted to 400 elements (in system/blockMeshDict) and the time step set to 0.0001 (in system/controlDict). 

A Python script for post-processing is available in "tutorial/Py" folder. The Python script requires the fluidfoam package to be installed and it is freely available at https://github.com/fluiddyn/fluidfoam .
